RocketCDN plugin automatically rewrites all URLs to be served by our content delivery network (CDN). Easy CDN deployment to WordPress.

== Description ==

RocketCDN is a premium optimized Content Delivery Network that helps you deliver your content at the speed of light.


If your website aims to reach an international audience, the distance from your visitors’ origin server has a significant impact on performance. With RocketCDN, anyone can access your content quickly, no matter where they are in the world! Forget configuration headaches too, we automatically apply the best CDN configuration to boost your speed and performance grades.

Reduce latency, round trip time (RTT) and save bandwidth costs with our customized Content Delivery Network: RocketCDN is here to make your website faster and your visitors happy.

RocketCDN makes for an easy CDN integration to WordPress.

Once you’ve installed and activated RocketCDN to your WordPress site, the plugin will automatically rewrite all URLs, such as those for CSS, JavaScript, and images, to be served by a content delivery network. You will be able to link up your assets to your RocketCDN custom CName. Moreover, the CDN cache can be cleared from WordPress, making your content always up to date, super easily.

= WHAT IS A CDN AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? =

The acronym CDN stands for Content Delivery Network: a CDN establishes a globally distributed network of edge servers between your website’s origin server and your visitors’ location.

Once the content of your site passes through them for the first time, the edge servers keep a copy of the static content (images, CSS and JavaScript files) and then deliver it to the end-users, allowing them to access the content a lot faster.
With a CDN, every HTTP request made by your users will be served from the nearest location possible, no matter where they’re geographically located.

If your website is serving a broad international audience, reaching people all over the world,  the distance between your website’s server and your users’ is one of the crucial factors of web performance.

Think of a Content Delivery Network as a bridge that makes users closer to the websites they’re visiting, no matter where they are in the globe!

= WHAT ABOUT PageSpeed Insights AND THE CORE WEB VITALS? =

If you think that Google loves fast and secure websites, we can indeed confirm that enabling a CDN on your site is also beneficial for SEO and the PageSpeed Insights performance score. In fact, using a Content Delivery Network can boost the Largest Contentful Paint score – one of the Core Web Vitals metrics.

Furthermore, a CDN can also have a positive impact on your server response time. Server response time is the amount of time required between the moment a visitor makes a request (clicks on a link for example) to the moment the server responds to that request. According to Google PageSpeed Insights, you should aim for a server response time of less than 200 ms. The response time of a server is typically measured with what is known as time to first byte (TTFB).
Your website’s loading time significantly affects user experience which is why reducing server response time should be a primary goal of website owners and SEO experts.

= HOW DOES IT WORK? =

Our plugin allows you to easily enable RocketCDN on your WordPress website. You can simply install the plugin, activate it and add the RocketCDN API key provided in your account.
Then all of your static assets on your website will be served through our content delivery network. Wherever your audience is, our +50 edge locations powered by StackPath can easily handle large volume traffic and unexpected peaks to deliver your content at the speed of light. StackPath edge locations are strategically deployed where users are most densely concentrated in 35 (and counting) markets.
Created by the WP Rocket team, RocketCDN also automatically applies the best CDN settings.
Cache expiration policy, GZIP compression, HTTP2... we set everything up to boost your speed and performance scores. Remember: a faster loading website will help you meet Core Web Vitals requirements. Don’t stress over the amount of bandwidth and number of requests either. With RocketCDN, experience high performance with unlimited bandwidth.
Furthermore, using RocketCDN requires absolutely no technical knowledge. You won't waste your time going through numerous tabs and complicated customization options. With our easy-to-navigate interface, we make CDN technology available to all. Let us do the heavy lifting, enjoy our custom automated Content Delivery Network settings.

= Is there a trial version or free demo? =

There is no free trial period, but you may request a refund within 24 hours after the subscription. If you cancel later, when the billing month has already started, you will be charged for the full month in any case.

We offer a single pricing for every need. For only $8.99/month, you will provide better user experience to your visitors, no matter where they are in the world.

= Does RocketCDN offer dedicated support? =
Yes. Our team is always ready to assist if you have any questions or issues with our CDN. You can contact them through [this page](https://dev.rocketcdn.me/contact/).

= Do you offer CNAME customization, aka a “vanity URL”? =
No. We decided to not offer the CNAME customization because:
- It would require a valid SSL certificate that supports subdomains on your side, the lack of which can affect the CDN’s functionality.
- There isn’t any real benefit from having one except for avoiding SEO penalties for duplicate content. To avoid this we automatically set canonical headers.

= Can I use RocketCDN on unlimited sites? =
No. Each site requires its own RocketCDN subscription. Therefore, if you have a staging site and a production site, you won't be able to transfer RocketCDN between them, you should subscribe using your production site.

= Can I use RocketCDN in addition to Cloudflare? =
Yes, you can use RocketCDN and Cloudflare together. Cloudflare is not a traditional CDN (technically speaking, it’s a proxy) therefore it’s possible to use it at the same time as RocketCDN.

Cloudflare provides other useful features related to security, for example. RocketCDN will take care of delivering static files - JS, CSS, images - to your visitors from servers close to them.

The benefit of RocketCDN is that we’ve created the service to configure everything optimally for you. We do the following automatically:
- Create your unique rocketcdn.me CNAME - (this cannot be changed or customized.)
- Apply GZIP compression
- Apply CORS headers for webfont compatibility
- Set a cache-control browser cache header
- Serve assets over HTTP/2

RocketCDN also provides these benefits:
- Unlimited bandwidth
- We reserve the right to disable your RocketCDN Url if we detect bandwidth overuse
- All CDN files automatically served over HTTPS
- SSL Traffic included
- All Global PoPs (Points of Presence) included

If you’re trying to choose only one service to use, we cannot say which is better, they are simply different, so you would have to perform tests to check the results for your specific site.

= What's the difference between RocketCDN and Stackpath? =
RocketCDN provides a convenient and fast, one-click setup. We take care of the ideal setup automatically so you don't have to spend any time on it. If you go through Stackpath directly, it requires manual configuration. If you have only one site it will be cheaper to use RocketCDN. For multiple sites, Stackpath is cheaper, although you'll invest more time in setup.

= Can I use RocketCDN and Jetpack Site Accelerator? =
No. You should disable Jetpack site accelerator when using RocketCDN.

= Can I use Amazon S3 with RocketCDN? =
Amazon S3 can't be used with another CDN provider like RocketCDN. You can't mix a PUSH CDN with a PULL CDN. You have to choose between them.

= What are the basic requirements for RocketCDN to work? =
1. As RocketCDN is a pull CDN, your site must be publicly accessible for the assets to be pulled from your server, that means it won't work for locally hosted sites or sites blocked from the public by htaccess authentication, "maintenance mode" plugins or similar.
2. The following IP has to be allowlisted by your server, firewall, or security plugin to be able to subscribe : 146.59.251.59
3. All StackPath previous CDN subscriptions for your domain must be deleted.
